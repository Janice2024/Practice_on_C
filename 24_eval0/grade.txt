Formatting:    OK
Documentation: Good
Comments from your grader:
Good work. A few things to improve are formatting and documentation. Brace 
placement and comma spacing is inconsistent—recommend using clang-format or 
format on save. Each function should have a comment describing what it does, 
and some of these comments go with other functions.
Give main a parameter list! Even if it’s void. main needs to return an int!
